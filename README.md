# A-Very-Simple-CMS
This is a very simple CMS I created on my localhost server. It uses mySQL as its database and is coded using PHP.
I used an OOP approach when creating this. 
I removed the passwords from the classes/methods that are used to connect to the database for obvious reasons (they were replaced with "(removed)".
This CMS allows a user to create a username and password (that are stored in a database), login to the site (which checks the entered information against information stored in the database), and add posts to the site (which are stored and retrieved from the database). The user must be logged in to add a post.
